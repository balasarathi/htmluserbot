Hey! My name is HTML bot. I am a group management bot, here to help you get around and keep the order in your groups!
I have lots of handy features, such as flood control, a warning system, a note keeping system, and even predetermined replies on certain keywords.

Helpful commands:
- /start: Starts me! You've probably already used this.
- /help: Sends this message; I'll tell you more about myself!
- /donate: Gives you info on how to support me and my creator.

If you have any bugs or questions on how to use me, have a look at my website, or head to @vickyorflowerbotnews.
 All commands can be used with the following: / !</p>
